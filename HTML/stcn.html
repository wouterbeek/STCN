  <body>
    <h1>STCN, Short Title Catalogue Netherlands</h1>
    <p>The STCN contains 139.817 entries. These have been parsed for the
       following KMC codes. This page documents (1) what data has been parsed
       and turned into RDF(S), (2) what other datasets the parsed STCN data
       has been linked to, and (3) some of the undocumented values we came
       across during the process.</p>
    <h2>KMC 0500 - Status</h2>
    <p>The STCN documents three values (<i>Aav</i>, <i>Abv</i>, <i>Acv</i>),
       but 23 PPNs contain other values (these values are documented in GGC).
    </p>
    <table border="1">
      <tr><th>STCN code</th><th>Number of PPNs</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Aav</td><td>132.670</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Abv</td><td>6.608</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Acv</td><td>516</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Other GGC codes (not defined for STCN)</td><td>23</td></tr>
    </table>
    <h2>KMC 1100 - Year</h2>
    <p>139.817 PPNs (100%) have a year value. Of these 126.598 (91%) are
       exactly dated and 12.219 (9%) are approximately dated. The year values
       that occur in the STCN range from 1473 (earliest) to 1847 (latest).</p>
    <h2>KMC 1200 - Typographic property</h2>
    <p>There are 419.711 typographic property values in the STCN. All of them
       are mapped to appropriate resources. For this conversion we have made
       decisions on how to represent undocumented values (see the list below).
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Some PPNs use this code to encode some completely different
          property. E.g. PPN 14162843X, PPN 14162843X, PPN 314559655.</li>
      <li>'1' (the number between 0 and 2) seems to occur to be a typo of 'l'
          (the letter between 'k' and 'm'). E.g. PPN 321339320.</li>
      <li>Uppercase variants of documented lowercase versions occur.
          E.g. PPN 298324997, PPN 305305972.</li>
      <li>Some PPNs have the undocumented value '5'. E.g. PPN 271591978.</li>
      <li>Some PPNs have the undocumented value '9'. E.g. PPN 301032831.</li>
      <li>The value 'w.' (with the dot) seems to occur as a variant of 'w'
          (without the dot). E.g. PPN 204513316.</li>
      <li>'v' occurs in the STCN documentation, but not in the GGC
          documentation.</li>
      <li>'b)' seems to be a variant of 'b'. E.g. PPN 261654624.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>KMC 1500 - Language</h2>
    <p>The STCN and GGC do not distinguish languages from language families.
    </p>
    <p>139.801 PPNs have a language value. All of these have at least a
       value for the language of the work itself.
       23.586 of these PPNs (with known language) also have a value for a
       language from which they were translated.
       827 of these PPNs (with known language) also have a value for the
       language via which they were translated.
       53 languages occur in the STCN.</p>
    <p>Language codes have been linked to languages in the ISO standards
       639-1, 639-2, 639-3; and to language families in the ISO standard
       639-5. The URIs are drawn from the Lexvo dataset.</p>
    <p>The Lexvo dataset links languages and language families to several
       other resources. For example the Dutch language is linked to the
       following resources:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>owl:sameAs http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dutch_language</li>
        <li>owl:sameAs http://psi.oasis-open.org/iso/639/#nld</li>
        <li>owl:sameAs http://www.lingvoj.org/lang/nl</li>
        <li>owl:sameAs http://www.mpii.de/yago/resource/Dutch_language</li>
      </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>The following translations have been made to bring the STCN/GGC
          language codes in agreement with ISO standards (STCN lhs; ISO rhs):
        <ol>
          <li>arm --- hye</li>
          <li>chi --- cmn</li>
          <li>dmh --- gmh</li>
          <li>fri --- fry, ISO 639-3 distinguishes between the West-Frisian
              (spoken in The Netherlands) and the North-Frisian language
              (spoken in Germany). West-Frisian has been chosen as the
              translation in all cases.</li>
          <li>grk --- grc</li>
          <li>hon --- hun</li>
          <li>jap --- jpn</li>
          <li>ned --- nld</li>
          <li>per --- fas</li>
          <li>zwe --- swe</li>
        </ol></li>
      <li>Some PPNs have language families encoded i.o. individual languages:
        <ol>
          <li>Prakrit (pra) used in PPN 303735422</li>
          <li>Iroquoian (iro) used in PPN 305228218</li>
          <li>Creole or Pidgin (crp) used in PPNs 301776601, 23838229X</li>
        </ol></li>
      <li>There are 84 language codes that are documented by GGC but that are
          not in the ISO standards. These language codes do not occur in the
          STCN.</li>
      <li>There are multiple ways of specifying that the (exact) language is
          unknown.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>KMC 1700 - Countries</h2>
    <p>139.778 PPNs (99.97%) have a country value. 7.574 PPNs (5.4%) have,
       in addition to that, a value for the actual country in which they
       were published (which is different from the country that is mentioned
       in the publication itself). 34 countries occur in the STCN.
    </p>
    <p>Country codes have been completely (all PPNs) linked to countries in
       the ISO standard 3266-1. The URIs are drawn from the Lexvo dataset.</p>
    <p>The Lexvo dataset links countries to several other resources.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Czechoslovakia no longer exists (as of 1992), so country code
          <i>cs</i> is currently obsolete.</li>
      <li>There are 21 country codes that are documented by GGC but that are
          not in the ISO standards. These country codes do not occur in the
          STCN.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>KMC 3000 and KMCs 3011 through 3019</h2>
    <p>Primary and secondary authors are linked to their Picarta entries.
       Picata does not have a linked dataset yet, so we used page scraping
       for this. Picarta is still a good linker, since it uses PPN codes for
       author which are unique identifiers.</p>
    <p>PPN statistics related to authors:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>93.724 PPNs (67%) have at least one author.</li>
      <li>86.324 PPNs (62%) have a primary author.<\li>
      <li>70.040 PPNs (50%) only have a primary author.<\li>
      <li>23.684 PPNs (17%) have a secondary author.<\li>
      <li>7.400 PPNs (5%) only have a secondary author.</li>
      <li>2.244 PPNs (1.6%) are written under pseudonym.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Author statistics:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The STCN contains 22.814 authors.</li>
      <li>All authors were found in Picarta (which is evident, since Picarta
          contains the STCN).
      <li>578 authors (2.5%) were linked to DBpedia entries.</li>
      <li>445 authors (2.0%) are pseudonyms of authors within the STCN
          dataset.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>KMC 4062 Format</h2>
    <p>The following formats are not documented. The values for
       'kettinglijnen' are infered from the other formats.
    <table border="1">
      <tr><th>Name</th><th>Assumed value for 'kettinglijnen'</th></tr>
      <tr><td>32mo</td><td>vertical</td></tr>
      <tr><td>48mo</td><td>vertical</td></tr>
      <tr><td>64mo</td><td>horizontal</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Other</td><td>none</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>The following formats seem to be mistakes and have been mapped to
       documented formats:
    <table border="1">
      <tr><th>Unrecognized value</th><th>Assumed equivalent value</th><th>Comment</th></tr>
      <tr><td>?</td><td>UnknownFormat</td><td></td></tr>
      <tr><td>&#176;</td><td>UnknownFormat</td><td></td></tr>
      <tr><td>4&#231;</td><td>4&#176;</td><td></td></tr>
      <tr><td>4 for example</td><td>4&#176; for example</td><td>Recognized values without the '&#176;'</td></tr>
      <tr><td>agenda</td><td>Agenda</td><td>Case-distinction</td></tr>
      <tr><td>oblong</td><td>Oblong</td><td>Case-distinction</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Other&#176;</td><td>Other</td><td>Recognized values with an extra '&#176;'</td></tr>
      <tr><td>8 &#176;</td><td>8&#176;</td><td>E.g. PPN 236634119</td></tr>
      <tr><td>8&#234;</td><td>8&#176;</td><td>E.g. PPN 109363094</td></tr>
      <tr><td>12 &#176;</td><td>12&#176;</td><td>E.g. PPN 189120959</td></tr>
      <tr><td>?&#234;</td><td>Unknown</td><td>E.g. PPN 109361423</td></tr>
      <tr><td>4&#234;</td><td>4&#176;</td><td>E.g. PPN 108526747</td></tr>
      <tr><td>2&#234;</td><td>2&#176;</td><td>E.g. PPN 108495264</td></tr>
      <tr><td>NUMBER x NUMBER mm</td><td>Unknown</td><td>E.g. PPN 317798766, PPN 31858817X</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>Then there are some more idiosyncratic problems we have come accross:
    <ol>
      <li>It is not possible to distinguish between formats 24mo-long and
       24mo based on the STCN data. Currently these formats are treated as
       one and the same.</li>
      <li>PPN 333614321 contains a value that is very different from the
          documented formats.</li>
      <li>PPN 31858817X has the following value: '2 volumes'.</li>
      <li>PPN 291582117 contains an extra space at the beginning.
          See also PPN 115264302</li>
      <li>It is not possible to distinguish between formats 'duodecimolong'
       and 'duodecimocommon' based on the STCN data. Currently these formats
       are treated as one and the same.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Using the redactiebladen parsed created by data2semantics / VU</h1>

      <li>Create a directory <span class="directory_name">.STCN</span> in
        your home folder and copy the
        redactiebladen text file (uncompressed) there. Give the file the
        name <span class="file_name">redactiebladen.txt</span>.</li>
      <li>In the console run the command
        <span class="shell_command">swipl -s stcn.pl</span>.
      <li>In the SWI-Prolog console run the following:

      <li>Open a Web browser on <tt>http://localhost:5000/prasem/</tt>.
        From the Web interface you can run various commands (described in
        the next section) to check the parsing process.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Detailed documentation</h2>
    <p>Detailed documentation was written for each of the files in the
       codebase. For the files covering the respective KMCs, the documentation
       includes all the exceptions we came across while building the parser,
       as well as complete tables of legal and illegal values.</p>
    <p>The detailed documentation is accessed by running the
       <tt>documentation</tt> command from the Web-interface.</p>
    <h2>Displaying dynamic tables in the detailed documentation</h2>
    <p>If you want to make the dynamic tables visible in the plDoc
      documentation server, you need to add the following clause to the
      <span class="predicate_name">take_block</span> predicate in module
      <span class="module_name">pldoc/doc_wiki.pl</span> of your SWI-Prolog
      installation. (This code cannot be included in SWI-Prolog releases
      because of the security implications of running arbitrary code on the
      documentation server.</p>
    <pre>

    <h2>Commands run from the Web interface</h2>
    <p>The Web interface can be run locally (as described above) or a sample
       version of it can be run only at
       <tt>http://http://semanticweb.cs.vu.nl/prasem/</tt>.</p>
    <p>The Web interface shows a console in which commands can be given. The
